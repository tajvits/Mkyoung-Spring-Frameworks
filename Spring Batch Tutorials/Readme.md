[Spring Batch](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/), is an open source framework for batch processing – execution of a series of jobs. Spring Batch provides classes and APIs to read/write resources, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart and partitioning techniques to process high-volume of data.

The following Spring Batch tutorials and examples are tested with :
