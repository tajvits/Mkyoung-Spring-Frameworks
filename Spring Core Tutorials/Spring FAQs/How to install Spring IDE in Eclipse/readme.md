[Spring IDE](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-ide) is a very useful graphical user interface tool adding support for Spring Framework. In this tutorial, we show you two ways to install Spring IDE in Eclipse.

Version used in this tutorial :

1.  Spring IDE 2.9
2.  Eclipse 3.7

**Spring IDE or SpringSource Tool Suite (STS)?**  
Refer to this [Spring IDE vs STS pdf file](http://download.springsource.com/release/STS/doc/STS-feature_comparison.pdf) for feature comparison. Personally, I go for Spring IDE for one reason – just can’t let go my existing Eclipse, too many plugins installed.

## 1\. Install New Software

Classic way, Eclipse IDE, click “**Help**” -> “**Install New Software**…”. Type “**http://springide.org/updatesite**” to access the Spring IDE update site.

Select all the Spring IDE features you want to install.

Take long time to install and restart Eclipse after finished.

## 2\. Eclipse Marketplace

This is the prefer way, because you no need to remember the long Spring ide update URL. In Eclipse IDE, click “**Help**” -> “**Eclipse Marketplace**“, type “**Spring IDE**“, follow the wizard to finish the installation.
